  <div class="top"><p>The vast desert of Soladaarn west beyond the Fence Mountain Range to the Serpant River on the border of the Southern Darklands.
Now an arid wasteland which once was a temperate decidous forest inhabited by mighty kingdoms of elves and humans millenia past.</p><p>  The remnants of the forest settled on the eastern edge now petrified trees make up a labyrinth called the Dead Stone Forest.
</p><p>The Fence Mountain Range borders on the east and explains the transformation of this once ideal clime to its current desert form. The dwarves dug too readily and too deep creating mountain fortresses out of the tailings from overminig the resources of the forest kingdoms.  Now known as the Fence mountain range it is one of the seventeen wonders of Azhalis and displays the unrivaled craftmanship of weaponsmithing, Armory, and jewel making within its dwarf built halls.</p><p>
<p>In the north of Soladaarn lies the Dune Sea; a massive desolate sea of sand and sun. mysteries and legands are buried under its scorching sand.  To the south along the winding Serpant river abide the remnants of the lost kingdoms of Soladaarn; many artifacts of power are said to be contained in their ancient halls.  A modern day city resides on top of the ancient runes.  Many traders visit the exotic wares of the inner city of Teyn.</p>
